# Data-Logger-Project

This is a Data Logger based on the Arduino Uno and a Data Logger Shield, which measures temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure and stores the data on an SD card once every 5 minutes in CSV format for later spreadsheet/graphing use. The software is for a version which sits in my friend Dave's Cellar and monitors his pool table.

The Updated version has more generic text but is otherwise identical. This hardware uses the Adafruit Data Logger shield Mk2, which uses the PCF8523 RTC instead of the DS1307 RTC in the generic Chinese shield of the prototype. It is worthy of note that I was unable to make the Adafruit Data Logger shield Mk2 work as advertised with either of my two Arduino Mega R3, including a Genuino,so one for Adafruit to advise I think.
