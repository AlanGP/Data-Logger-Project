# Data-Logger-Project

This is a Data Logger based on the Arduino Uno and a Data Logger Shield, which measures temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure and stores the data on an SD card once every 5 minutes in CSV format for later spreadsheet/graphing use. The software is for a version which sits in my friend Dave's Cellar and monitors his pool table.

The Updated version has more generic text but is otherwise identical.
